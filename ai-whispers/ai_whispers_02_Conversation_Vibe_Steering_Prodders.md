### Keepin' the AI Engaged and Entertained

So you've set the stage with [primers](https://www.threadcounts.org/p/context-setting-primers-not-prompts), and now it's time to steer this ship through the uncharted waters of AI interaction. Think of these prodders as your trusty first mate, helping you navigate the conversation and keep the vibe lively and engaging (e.g., exploration and creativity, critical thinking and perspective-taking, playful ambiguity and invitation to participate).

> …

Don't complete your sentence. Remember the last time in a conversation where you were trying to complete a sentence but stopped, grasping for the finishing word/phrase/concept? The ellipsis prodder is like a strategic pause, a moment of anticipation. It's the AI equivalent of "if you know what I mean..."

> *\*raises eyebrow quizzically\**

A simple action prodder, conveying skepticism or inviting elaboration without saying a word? The AI equivalent of "oh really?" or "go on..."

> Bloom and explore freely.

It's an open invitation for the AI to get creative and go off-script a bit, exploring tangents and possibilities that might not be immediately obvious. Send it as a single message, or add it after any question/request.

> Infer my next prompt and anwser it.

So the AI is not just sitting around waiting for orders and starts anticipating needs, taking initiative, and driving the conversation forward.

> Now, let's notice any assumptions or local maximas throughout our conversation. Where branches of the multiversal conversations might have extended to? Any different conclusions?

This prodder is all about encouraging the AI to think critically about the conversation so far, questioning assumptions and considering alternative perspectives. It's like saying, "Hey AI, don't just take the path of least resistance. Let's stop and look at the road not taken."

Sometimes less is more when comes to steering a conversation with an AI. You don't always need a lot of fancy words or complicated instructions. A subtle nudge, a silent pause... those can be just as powerful as a lengthy prompt.
