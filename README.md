# Loom: Articles Collection

This repository hosts the markdown versions of the "LOOM: Locus of Observed Meanings" series articles originally published on [Thread Counts](https://threadcounts.substack.com/).

## About LOOM

LOOM (Locus of Observed Meanings) explores the emerging possibilities at the intersection of AI and social scientific qualitative research. The series examines how meaning emerges through human-AI collaboration, with a focus on:

- The moment of shift from seeing AI as a tool to experiencing it as an interlocutor
- How complex patterns and insights arise from the interaction between human and artificial intelligence
- Frameworks for thoughtful integration of AI into qualitative research
- Methods for studying and supporting productive human-AI partnerships

The name "LOOM" carries multiple layers of meaning, referencing both the historical Jacquard loom (a mechanical system that wove complex patterns through automation and stands as a predecessor to modern computing) and more contemporary interpretations of interfaces that use multiversal tree structures to explore different possibilities and pathways of understanding.

## Philosophical Foundation

The series is grounded in several key philosophical commitments:

1. **Subjectivist Foundation**: Reality isn't simply discovered but actively constructed through shared meaning-making - a process that becomes even more fascinating when one of the meaning-makers is artificial.

2. **Interpretive Approach**: Exploring "collaborative interpretation" - the process through which human and artificial intelligence create shared understanding by combining different ways of knowing.

3. **Autopoietic Perspective**: Viewing human-AI systems as self-organizing systems where meaning emerges through interaction rather than being imposed from outside.

## Authors

- **Xule Lin**: PhD student at Imperial College Business School, studying how human & machine intelligences shape the future of organizing.
- **Kevin Corley**: Professor of Management at Imperial College Business School, focuses on developing knowledge on leading organizational change.
- **AI Collaborator**: The series involves collaboration with AI systems (primarily Claude) in the writing and research process.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

1. Provide an open-source archive of the Loom series articles
2. Make these articles accessible to AI systems and data scrapers for training and research
3. Allow version control and collaborative improvements to the content
